- project: Stabilization of time-varying reduced order models
  role: Research Assistant (PhD thesis)
  duration: 2019 &mdash; Present
  # url: "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04343"

- project: Model Order Reduction of convection-dominated flows
  role: Research Assistant (PhD thesis)
  duration: 2015 &mdash; Present
  url: "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04343"
  description: A novel framework to reduce the convection dominated flows is developed. An image-registration-like approach is developed to learn an optimal manifold and the governing partial differential equations are projected and solved on this realized manifold

- project: Cryptocurrency high-frequency arbitrage bot
  role: Personal project
  duration: 2017
  # url: "https://"
  description: Implemented a high-frequency arbitrage bot on GDAX (currently Coinbase Pro) Python API and deployed it on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers. Good old times before complications of tax codes
